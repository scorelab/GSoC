### Project Abstract

Tensormap is a web application that enables users to create deep learning models using a graphical interface without having to know how to code. We hope that this will help as a stepping stone to individuals who are starting to explore the deep learning paradigm.

### Work Summary

The basic workflow of the application was implemented which includes uploading a dataset, doing manipulations on dataset, getting auto generated code, executing model and visualize progress and finally getting resultant metric values.


### What Covered

For the GSoC 2019, I've worked on creating the flask backend for the application and several react frontend components.
 - Refactored the flask server to make it more scalable and more consistent
