### Project Abstract

The Fact Bounty project is intended to solve the issue of the spread of fake news by using crowdsourcing to identify the validity of content posted in social platforms. The Fact Bounty project contains three main sub-projects, the Web Apllication (which is the main point of user interaction), the Flask Backend (the api which is consumed by the web app) and the Web crawlers (which is used to web scrape the news items). I was mostly invloved in contributing to the the Fact Bounty Web App!
