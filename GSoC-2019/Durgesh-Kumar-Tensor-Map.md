### Project Abstract
TensorMap is a web application that will allow the users to create machine learning algorithms visually. TensorMap supports reverse engineering of the visual layout to a Tensorflow implementation in preferred languages.

### Work Summary
I worked mainly on frontend part of the project TensorMap, with fellow gsocers where a build a functionality to create artificial neural network architecture by dragging and dropping the relevant node to the workspace from the scratch. I also contributed to the integration of preprocessing part with the frontend.

### What Covered

* Create different nodes(input, hidden, output) by dropping to the workspace **:** [`PR-2`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/7) [`PR-3`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/9)
* Link different nodes that define flow to data and model **:** [`PR-3`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/20)
* Group Various node to form a layer. **:** [`PR-5`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/29)
* Define different parameters associated with nodes and layers. **:** [`PR-3`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/20) [`PR-4`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/23)
* Manually update and retrieve weight of links **:** [`PR-4`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/23)
* specify model compilation and execution configuration (like learning rate, optimizer, etc) **:** [`PR-3`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/20)
* View Runtime results **:** [`PR-5`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/29)
* Get the generated code **:** [`PR-2`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/7)
* Linking pre processing part with frontend **:** [`PR-6`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/31)
* Material-UI upload data form **:** [`PR-7`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/32)
* Material-UI Tabular View to view uploaded files as well as data **:** [`PR-7`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/32)
* Readme.md, Travis, Contributing.md **:** [`PR-1`](https://github.com/scorelab/TensorMap/pull/5)

### What left
Runtime results tab is hardcoded, callback function to updated data after execution.
