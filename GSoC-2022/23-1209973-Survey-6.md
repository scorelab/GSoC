# Survey6

# Project Abstract

The internet is constantly evolving, and IPv6 is playing a crucial role in shaping its future. To better understand how routing and DNS work in an IPv6 environment, we have developed a user-friendly and highly scalable survey tool known as an IPv6 listener.

The main goal of this project is to create a tool that actively collects IPv6 traffic data for cyber security research. Here's how we've made it more user-friendly:

Easy Setup: We have designed the IPv6 listener to be easy to set up, even for users without extensive technical knowledge. The installation process is streamlined, and we provide clear instructions and documentation to guide users through the initial setup.

Intuitive Interface: The user interface of the IPv6 listener is designed with simplicity in mind. It features a clean and intuitive layout, making it easy for researchers and security professionals to navigate and access the relevant functionalities.

Automated Data Collection: The listener automates the process of collecting IPv6 traffic data, eliminating the need for manual intervention. Users can set specific parameters or filters to target the data they are interested in, such as specific IP addresses, protocols, or timeframes. This flexibility allows researchers to focus on the data that matters most to their research objectives.

Data Visualization: We understand the importance of presenting data in a meaningful way. Our IPv6 listener includes built-in data visualization features that transform raw traffic data into clear graphs, charts, and statistics. This visual representation helps users easily identify patterns, anomalies, and potential security threats within the collected data.

Comprehensive Reporting: The tool generates comprehensive reports that summarize the findings and insights obtained from the collected IPv6 traffic data. These reports are designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences, ensuring that the research findings can be effectively communicated and understood.

By making the IPv6 listener user-friendly, we aim to empower researchers and security professionals to delve into IPv6 traffic analysis without being overwhelmed by technical complexities. This tool serves as a valuable asset in understanding the intricacies of routing, DNS, and cyber security in the IPv6 landscape.

# Work Summary

During GSoc 2022, I contributed to the development of an active scanner in Survey 6. My responsibilities involved organizing the folder structure and creating the build file. Additionally, I implemented a ping function using sockets to determine the reachability of IPv6 addresses. To enhance efficiency, I focused on optimizing the scanner by utilizing threads.

# What's Covered

- Generates all the ipv6 addresses for a given network range.
- the reachability of each IPv6 address.
- Use threading to improve performance.
- saves the results to a CSV file

# What's left

- Optimizing the scanner by generating ipv6 address for the given network range using a statistical modal.
- Identifying alias ipv6 addresses.
