# Survey6

# Project Abstract

Ipv6 is the internet's future, and it necessitated a more scalable survey tool to comprehend how routing and DNS function. The purpose of this project is to create an IPv6 listener that will actively collect IPv6 traffic data as a active data collection tool for cyber security research.

# Work Summary

In GSoc 2022, I worked on the development of the active scanner in Survey6. Decided the folder strucutre and created the build file. Created a ping function using sockets to check the reachbility of the ipv6 address. Worked on optimization using threads.

# What Covered

- Generates all the ipv6 addresses for a given network range.
- For each Ipv6 check its reachbility.
- Use threading to improve performance.
- saves the results to a CSV file

# What left

- Optimizing the scaner by generating ipv6 address for the given network range using a statistical modal.
- Identifying alias ipv6 addresses.
